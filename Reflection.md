# Reflection: Challenges in Aligning Agile with Stakeholders and Implementing it in GitHub

## 1. Challenges in Aligning Agile with Stakeholders

One of the key challenges I encountered when aligning Agile with stakeholders was that I was the **only stakeholder** in the project. This presented several difficulties:

### 1.1 Lack of Diverse Input 
- Agile thrives on collaboration and continuous feedback from multiple stakeholders.  
- Without external input, it was difficult to validate priorities, refine user stories, or adapt to evolving needs.  

### 1.2 No Direct User Engagement  
- Typically, Agile involves regular discussions with users (students, teachers, admins) to ensure the product meets real-world needs.   
- Without other stakeholders, I had to rely on assumptions rather than actual user feedback.  

### 1.3 Limited Perspectives in Decision-Making   
- In an Agile environment, stakeholders help prioritize features based on business value and user impact.  
- Since I was the sole stakeholder, I had to make all decisions, which may have introduced bias or gaps in prioritization.  

### 1.4 Challenges in Sprint Reviews & Feedback Loops   
- Agile encourages continuous feedback through sprint reviews and retrospectives.   
- Without other stakeholders to review progress, there was no external validation of completed features.  


## 2. Challenges in Implementing Agile in GitHub

### **2.1 Structuring Agile Workflow in GitHub**  
- Mapping Agile workflows (such as Kanban or Scrum) to GitHub tools (Projects, Issues, and Milestones) can be complex.  
- Ensuring a proper setup with GitHub Projects and Labels improves clarity and workflow efficiency.  

### **2.2 Managing User Stories & Tasks**  
- Translating user stories into GitHub Issues requires proper structuring and tagging.  
- Using templates for Issues and Pull Requests helps maintain consistency.  

### **2.3 Tracking Progress & Burndown Charts**  
- Unlike dedicated Agile tools (e.g., Jira, Trello), GitHub lacks built-in burndown charts.  
- Integrating third-party tools like ZenHub or GitHub Actions can help track sprint progress effectively.  

### **2.4 Collaboration & Code Reviews**  
- Ensuring developers follow Agile best practices, such as frequent commits and pull requests, requires discipline.  
- Setting up clear branching strategies (e.g., GitFlow) and automating code reviews with GitHub Actions improves workflow.  

## Lessons Learned & Possible Solutions
- **Seek External Input Whenever Possible**  
  - Even if formal stakeholders aren't available, getting informal feedback from potential users (students, teachers, admins) could provide valuable insights.  

- **Use Proxies for Stakeholders**  
  - Researching similar systems or consulting subject matter experts can help simulate stakeholder perspectives.  

- **Self-Check Using Agile Principles**  
  - Regularly reviewing priorities and assumptions can help maintain objectivity and adaptability.  

Despite these challenges, working within Agile principles helped me maintain focus on delivering value incrementally. Future iterations could benefit from additional user involvement to refine and validate features effectively.
