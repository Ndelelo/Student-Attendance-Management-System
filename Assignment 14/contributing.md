## Coding Standards

We follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code. Additionally:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Maximum line length of 88 characters (we use Black formatter)
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Linting

We use the following tools to ensure code quality:

- **Black**: For code formatting
  ```bash
  black .
  ```

- **Flake8**: For style guide enforcement
  ```bash
  flake8
  ```

- **isort**: For import sorting
  ```bash
  isort .
  ```

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Maintain or improve test coverage with your changes
- Run tests locally before submitting a PR

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=.
```

## Issue Selection Process

2. **Comment on the issue**
   - Express your interest in working on the issue
   - Ask any questions you might have about the requirements
   - Wait for a maintainer to assign the issue to you

3. **Work on the issue**
   - Once assigned, follow the development workflow to implement your solution
   - If you're stuck, ask for help in the issue comment thread

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your PR addresses a specific issue**
   - Reference the issue number in your PR description using #issue-number

2. **Fill out the PR template**

   - List any dependencies that were added or removed

3. **Pass all checks**
   - Your PR must pass all automated tests and checks
   - Address any review comments from maintainers
