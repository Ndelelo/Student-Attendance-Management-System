## Kanban Board Explanation 

A **Kanban board** is a visual tool for workflow management, enabling teams to monitor activities throughout several phases of completion. Through visible task progress, it offers a methodical approach to view work, prioritize management, and increase productivity. Columns representing different phases of a process make up the board, allowing teams to identify bottlenecks, balance workloads, and continuously enhance efficiency.

### How Kanban Board Works

#### 1. Virtualizing Workflow
My Kanban board is structured with columns that represent different stages of tasks. Tasks move from left to right across the board as progress is made:

- **To Do** - Tasks planned but not yet started.
- **In Progress** - Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Review** - Tasks waiting for code review.
- **Testing** - Tasks undergoing functional testing.
- **Blocked** - Tasks stuck due to dependencies or issues.
- **Done** - Completed tasks.

#### 2. Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP)
My board features **WIP restrictions**, ensuring that only a limited number of tasks are in progress at any moment. This preserves efficiency and prevents congestion. The limits are as follows:

- **In Progress** column allows a maximum of three tasks.
- **Review** and **Testing** columns allow a maximum of two tasks at a time.

Enforcing these restrictions ensures that team members do not overload themselves with tasks, reducing multitasking and improving focus. If a column reaches its limit, no additional tasks can be added until existing ones are completed, promoting teamwork to clear obstacles before starting new tasks.

#### 3. Supporting Agile Principles
By aligning with Agile values, my Kanban board promotes:

- **Regular updates and faster job delivery**, as tasks move smoothly through the system.
- **Flexibility and adaptability**, allowing new projects to be added or reprioritized based on business needs without disrupting workflow.
- **Transparency and teamwork**, ensuring every team member clearly sees workloads, responsibilities, and priorities.

Regularly reviewing the board enhances productivity and guides decision-making based on real-time data, ultimately leading to improved team performance.
