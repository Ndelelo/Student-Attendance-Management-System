# Integration

## 1. Functional Requirements (FR)

These represent the main features of the system:

- **FR1**: Student Registration  
- **FR2**: Attendance Marking  
- **FR3**: Attendance Verification  
- **FR4**: Course Management  
- **FR5**: Notifications  
- **FR6**: Report Generation  
- **FR7**: Teacher Resignation  
- **FR8**: Student Graduation  

---

## 2. Workflows

Each functional requirement is linked to a workflow that describes how it operates. Example mappings:

- **FR1** → *Student Registration Workflow*  
- **FR2** → *Attendance Marking Workflow*  
- **FR5** → *Notification System Workflow*  
- *(Additional workflows exist for FR3–FR8 and follow the same structure.)*

## 3. User Stories (US)

These describe what different types of users want from the system:

- **US1**: *As a Student, I want to submit my registration form online.*  
- **US2**: *As a Teacher, I want to mark attendance for my class.*  
- **US3**: *As an Admin, I want to verify attendance records.*  
- **US5**: *As a Parent, I want to receive absence notifications.*

## 4. Sprint Tasks (ST)

Development tasks to implement the user stories:

- **ST1**: Design and develop student registration UI.  
- **ST2**: Create database schema for attendance records.  
- **ST3**: Implement attendance verification system.  
- **ST5**: Set up notification system for absences.

## 5. Flow and Relationships

The following diagram (or logical flow) connects functional requirements to workflows, user stories, and sprint tasks, illustrating how each piece of the system fits together:
